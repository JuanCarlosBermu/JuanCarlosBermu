    <summary><h3>üßë Juan's coding journey</h3></summary>
    As an IT Engineering Student

From the moment I chose to pursue IT engineering, I knew I was stepping into a field that would challenge me to think creatively and logically. The initial years were a whirlwind of learning programming fundamentals, understanding algorithms, and exploring data structures. My first encounter with coding was through C, where I struggled but eventually mastered the basics of procedural programming. This foundation served as a springboard into more advanced topics like databases, operating systems, and computer networks.

By my final year, I had developed a keen interest in web development. I took courses on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, which allowed me to create dynamic and interactive websites. One of my final projects involved building a desktop application using Java and Ms Sql Server that use a Azure server in order to access everywhere. This project not only showcased my technical skills but also emphasized the value of user-centered design.

Transitioning to Web Development

After graduating, I faced the challenging yet exciting task of entering the workforce. While searching for my first job, I took the opportunity to deepen my web development skills. I explored frameworks like ASP.NET Core MVC and began experimenting with backend development. These experiences broadened my understanding of the full development cycle.

As a web developer, I‚Äôve worked on diverse projects, including e-commerce platforms, portfolio websites, and business management tools. Each project has taught me something new, whether it‚Äôs optimizing database queries, enhancing application performance, or creating responsive designs. 

Looking back, my coding journey has been one of constant learning and adaptation. From being an eager student navigating the basics to becoming a professional honing my craft, every step has reinforced my passion for technology and problem-solving. My ultimate goal is to continue building meaningful applications that make a difference in people‚Äôs lives while staying curious and open to new challenges.
